## Recovery Method

The files were recovered by:

2. Examining function calls and usage patterns
3. Reconstructing the missing files based on their expected functionality
4. Following the security cleanup summary guidelines for configuration templates

## File Relationships

```

## Next Steps

To use the recovered system:
1. Copy `config.ini.example` to `config.ini`
2. Copy `server_config.ini.example` to `server_config.ini` (for production)
3. Fill in actual API keys and configuration values
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set up the database and run migrations

## Notes

- All sensitive data has been replaced with placeholder values as per the security cleanup
- The recovered files maintain the same functionality as the original files
- Configuration templates follow the security guidelines mentioned in `SECURITY_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
