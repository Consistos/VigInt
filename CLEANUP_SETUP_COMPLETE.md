# Automatic Cleanup - Setup Complete âœ…

## Summary

Your Vigint system now has **automatic cleanup** of old incident files and videos to prevent unlimited storage growth.

## âœ… What's Been Added

### 1. Automatic Cleanup System
- **Retention period**: 30 days (configurable)
- **Frequency**: Daily (automatic)
- **What gets cleaned**:
  - Offline incident files (`offline_incidents/`)
  - Mock service videos (`mock_sparse_ai_cloud/`)

### 2. Built-in Periodic Cleanup
- **Integrated into**: `AlertManager.send_email_alert()`
- **Runs**: Once per day automatically
- **Execution**: Background thread (non-blocking)
- **Logging**: Shows in main log file

```python
# In alerts.py
self.last_cleanup_time = 0
self.cleanup_interval = 24 * 60 * 60  # 24 hours
```

### 3. Standalone Cleanup Script
- **File**: `cleanup_old_incidents.py`
- **Usage**: Can be run manually anytime
- **Features**:
  - Dry-run mode
  - Customizable retention
  - Selective cleanup (incidents/videos)
  - Detailed statistics

### 4. Cron Job Setup Script
- **File**: `setup_cleanup_cron.sh`
- **Purpose**: Additional cleanup for systems that restart
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM
- **Optional**: But recommended for production

### 5. Documentation
- **AUTOMATIC_CLEANUP.md**: Complete cleanup documentation
- **INFRASTRUCTURE_FIXES_COMPLETE.md**: All fixes summary
- **README.md**: Updated with cleanup features

## Configuration

### Environment Variable (Primary Method)
```bash
# Set in .env or shell
export INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

**Recommended values**:
- `7` = 1 week (testing/development)
- `30` = 1 month (default, production)
- `90` = 3 months (compliance/auditing)

### In Code (Advanced)
Edit `alerts.py` line 29 for cleanup frequency:
```python
self.cleanup_interval = 24 * 60 * 60  # 24 hours (default)
# Or: 12 * 60 * 60  # 12 hours (more frequent)
```

## Usage

### Automatic (Default) âœ¨
**Nothing to do!** Cleanup runs automatically once per day when the system is running.

### Manual Cleanup (Optional)
```bash
# See what would be deleted (dry run)
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --dry-run

# Actually delete old files
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py

# Custom retention (e.g., 7 days)
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --days 7

# Clean only incidents
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --incidents-only

# Clean only videos
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --videos-only
```

### Cron Setup (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# One-time setup
./setup_cleanup_cron.sh

# Verify installation
crontab -l | grep cleanup
```

## Current Status

From your system (as of 2025-10-01):
```
Location: mock_sparse_ai_cloud/
Total files: 846 (423 videos + 423 metadata)
Total size: 118.06 MB
Files older than 30 days: 0 (all recent)

Next cleanup: No files to delete yet
When: Will automatically delete files as they age beyond 30 days
```

## What You'll See in Logs

### When Cleanup Runs
```
ðŸ§¹ Running automatic cleanup (retention: 30 days)
Scanning /Users/david2/dev/Vigint/mock_sparse_ai_cloud for files older than 2025-09-01
âœ… Cleanup complete: No files older than 30 days
```

### When Files Are Deleted
```
ðŸ§¹ Running automatic cleanup (retention: 30 days)
Deleted (age: 35.2 days, size: 1.24 MB): cloud_video_20250826_143022.mp4
Deleted (age: 35.2 days, size: 0.01 MB): cloud_video_20250826_143022.mp4.json
âœ… Cleanup complete: 2 files deleted, 1.25 MB freed
```

## Monitoring

### Check Cleanup Status
```bash
# View cleanup logs
grep "cleanup" vigint.log | tail -10

# Check storage usage
du -sh offline_incidents/ mock_sparse_ai_cloud/

# Count current files
find mock_sparse_ai_cloud/ -name "*.mp4" | wc -l
```

### Find Old Files Manually
```bash
# Files older than 30 days
find mock_sparse_ai_cloud/ -name "*.mp4" -mtime +30

# Files from last 7 days
find mock_sparse_ai_cloud/ -name "*.mp4" -mtime -7
```

## Safety Features

1. **Age-based deletion only** - Never deletes by size or random selection
2. **Dry-run testing** - Preview deletions before executing
3. **Detailed logging** - Every deletion is logged with age and size
4. **Error handling** - Errors reported but cleanup continues
5. **Non-destructive** - Only deletes specified file patterns

## Benefits

### Storage Management
- âœ… Prevents unlimited growth of incident files
- âœ… Automatically frees disk space
- âœ… Configurable retention periods
- âœ… No manual intervention needed

### Data Retention Compliance
- âœ… Automatic enforcement of retention policies
- âœ… Configurable per legal requirements
- âœ… Documented deletion process
- âœ… Logged audit trail

### System Performance
- âœ… Keeps directories clean and performant
- âœ… Faster file system operations
- âœ… Background execution doesn't block alerts
- âœ… Minimal resource usage

## Troubleshooting

### "Directory does not exist"
**Normal** - Means no offline incidents or videos yet. Directories are created when needed.

### Files Not Being Deleted
**Check age**: Are files actually old enough?
```bash
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --dry-run
```
If "Files to be deleted: 0", all files are within retention period.

### Want More Aggressive Cleanup
```bash
# Clean files older than 7 days instead of 30
python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --days 7
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
export INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

## Next Steps

### For Development/Testing
1. âœ… System is ready - cleanup runs automatically
2. Test with: `python3 cleanup_old_incidents.py --dry-run`
3. Monitor logs: `grep "cleanup" vigint.log`

### For Production Deployment
1. âœ… Cleanup is configured (30-day retention)
2. **(Optional)** Setup cron: `./setup_cleanup_cron.sh`
3. Set environment variable in production: `INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS=30`
4. Monitor storage monthly: `du -sh mock_sparse_ai_cloud/`

### For Compliance/Legal Requirements
1. Adjust retention: `export INCIDENT_RETENTION_DAYS=90` (or as required)
2. Document retention policy
3. Review logs regularly
4. Archive important incidents before deletion if needed

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
1. `cleanup_old_incidents.py` - Main cleanup script
2. `setup_cleanup_cron.sh` - Cron job setup script
3. `AUTOMATIC_CLEANUP.md` - Detailed documentation
4. `CLEANUP_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `alerts.py` - Added automatic cleanup integration
   - Line 28-29: Cleanup tracking variables
   - Line 58-59: Periodic cleanup call
   - Line 306-345: Cleanup methods

2. `README.md` - Updated feature list
   - Line 22-24: Added cleanup features

## Technical Details

### Cleanup Flow
```
1. System starts
   â†“
2. First alert sent
   â†“
3. Check: Time for cleanup? (24 hours since last)
   â”œâ”€ No â†’ Continue with alert
   â””â”€ Yes â†’ Start background cleanup thread
       â†“
       4. Scan directories
       â†“
       5. Find files older than retention period
       â†“
       6. Delete old files
       â†“
       7. Log statistics
       â†“
       8. Update last_cleanup_time
```

### Storage Calculation
- **Videos**: ~0.5-2 MB each
- **Metadata**: ~1-5 KB each
- **Incidents**: ~1-5 KB each

**Example**: 1000 videos/month = ~1.5 GB/month
- With 30-day retention: ~1.5 GB max storage
- Cleanup frees ~50 MB per day

## Summary

âœ… **Automatic cleanup is active**  
âœ… **30-day retention period configured**  
âœ… **Runs once per day automatically**  
âœ… **No manual intervention needed**  
âœ… **118 MB currently stored (all recent files)**  
âœ… **System will clean as files age**  

**Your request**: âœ… **Old incident files will be automatically removed after 30 days**

**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE - No further action required!**
