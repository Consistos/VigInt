# Incident Type Email Subject Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Solved
The `incident_type` returned by Gemini AI was not being included in email alert subjects. This has been **completely fixed**.

## Root Cause Identified
The main issue was in `video_analyzer.py` - the Gemini prompt was **missing** the `incident_type` field in the requested JSON structure.

### Before Fix:
```json
{
  "incident_detected": boolean,
  "confidence": float,
  "description": string,
  "analysis": string
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
{
  "incident_detected": boolean,
  "incident_type": string,     // ← ADDED THIS
  "confidence": float,
  "description": string,
  "analysis": string
}
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. `video_analyzer.py` ✅
**Critical Fix**: Added `incident_type` to the Gemini prompt JSON structure
```python
"incident_type": string,     // Describe the type of incident (e.g.: shoplifting, theft, vandalism)
```

### 2. `api_proxy.py` ✅
**Already Correct**: The API proxy prompt was already requesting `incident_type`
- Email subject creation properly uses `incident_type`
- Alert endpoint extracts `incident_type` from request data

### 3. `secure_video_analyzer.py` ✅
**Enhanced**: Updated to properly pass `incident_type` and `risk_level` in API payloads

### 4. `alerts.py` ✅
**Already Correct**: The alert system was already designed to include `incident_type` in email subjects

## Real Test Results ✅

### Actual Gemini Response:
```json
{
  "incident_detected": true,
  "incident_type": "vol",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "analysis": "L'image montre un individu manipulant des articles..."
}
```

### Actual Email Subject:
```
🚨 Vigint Alert - vol - SECURITY - 2025-08-29 17:15:35
```

## Email Subject Formats

### Direct Video Analyzer:
```
🚨 Vigint Alert - [incident_type] - [alert_type]
```
Examples:
- `🚨 Vigint Alert - shoplifting - SECURITY`
- `🚨 Vigint Alert - vol à l'étalage - SECURITY`

### API Proxy:
```
🚨 Vigint Alert - [incident_type] - [risk_level] - [timestamp]
```
Examples:
- `🚨 Vigint Alert - suspicious_behavior - [MEDIUM] - 2025-08-29 17:15:35`
- `🚨 Vigint Alert - vol - [HIGH] - 2025-08-29 17:15:35`

## Verification Tests ✅

All tests pass successfully:

1. **Prompt Consistency** ✅
   - Both `video_analyzer.py` and `api_proxy.py` request `incident_type`
   - JSON structures are consistent

2. **Gemini Response Parsing** ✅
   - Handles clean JSON responses
   - Handles JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks
   - Fallback parsing for malformed responses

3. **Data Flow** ✅
   - `incident_type` flows from Gemini → Analysis → Alert → Email
   - Both direct and API proxy paths work correctly

4. **Real Scenario** ✅
   - Actual Gemini AI detected incident with `incident_type: "vol"`
   - Email sent successfully with incident type in subject
   - Video attachment included

## System Status

🎉 **FULLY WORKING**: The incident_type fix is complete and verified

### What Works Now:
- ✅ Gemini AI returns `incident_type` in analysis
- ✅ `incident_type` is extracted and preserved through the system
- ✅ Email subjects include the specific incident type
- ✅ Both French and English incident types work
- ✅ Video attachments include incident metadata
- ✅ API proxy and direct analyzer both work correctly

### Example Incident Types Detected:
- `shoplifting`
- `vol` (French for theft)
- `vol à l'étalage` (French for shoplifting)
- `suspicious_behavior`
- `theft`
- `vandalism`

## Configuration Requirements

Ensure these environment variables are set for email alerts:
```bash
ALERT_EMAIL=your-alert-email@gmail.com
ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@company.com
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

## Monitoring

To verify the fix is working in production:

1. **Check Email Subjects**: Look for incident types in alert emails
2. **Monitor Logs**: Look for "incident_type" in analysis logs
3. **Test Alerts**: Use test scripts to verify functionality

## Future Enhancements

Now that incident_type is working, consider:
1. **Incident Categorization**: Map incident types to severity levels
2. **Alert Filtering**: Allow filtering alerts by incident type
3. **Analytics**: Track incident type frequency
4. **Localization**: Standardize incident types across languages

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - incident_type is now properly included in email alert subjects
