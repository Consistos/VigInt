   - âœ… Simultaneous analysis of multiple video sources
   - âœ… Automatic aggregation of groups of 4+ sources
   - âœ… Individual analysis for remainder sources
   - âœ… AI-powered security incident detection
   - âœ… French language alerts and analysis

2. **Configuration Management** (`multi_source_config.py`)
   - âœ… JSON-based persistent configuration
   - âœ… Dynamic source management
   - âœ… Analysis settings configuration
   - âœ… Validation and export/import capabilities

3. **Command-Line Interface** (`run_multi_source_analysis.py`)
   - âœ… Interactive management mode
   - âœ… Batch operations
   - âœ… Status monitoring
   - âœ… Quick start functionality

4. **Integration Layer** (`integrate_multi_source.py`)
   - âœ… RTSP configuration synchronization
   - âœ… Seamless integration with existing Vigint system
   - âœ… Health monitoring and status reporting

5. **Alert System Integration**
   - âœ… Email alerts with video evidence
   - âœ… Multi-camera incident correlation
   - âœ… French language incident reports
   - âœ… Video compilation from multiple sources

## ðŸ”§ Issue Resolution

### Email Alert Fix
**Problem**: Email alerts were not being sent due to configuration mismatch.

**Root Cause**: The system was loading `server_config.ini` which had email settings in an `[Alerts]` section, but the `AlertManager` was only looking in the `[Email]` section.

**Solution**: Updated `AlertManager` to check both `[Alerts]` and `[Email]` sections with proper fallback logic.

**Result**: âœ… Email alerts now working correctly for both individual and aggregated analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Aggregation Logic Implementation

The system successfully implements the requested aggregation logic:

### Examples:
- **4 sources**: 1 group of 4 (aggregated)
- **5 sources**: 1 group of 4 (aggregated) + 1 individual
- **6 sources**: 1 group of 4 (aggregated) + 2 individual
- **8 sources**: 2 groups of 4 (both aggregated)
- **9 sources**: 2 groups of 4 (aggregated) + 1 individual

### Aggregated Analysis Features:
- âœ… 2x2 composite frames with camera labels
- âœ… Multi-camera incident correlation
- âœ… Coordinated behavior detection across cameras
- âœ… Comprehensive video evidence from all involved cameras
