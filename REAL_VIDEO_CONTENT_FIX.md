# Real Video Content Fix - Status Report

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Email Videos Now Contain Real Content

### 🔍 Problem Identified
The email alerts were showing only "test frames" with dates and times instead of actual video content from the cameras.

### 🎯 Root Cause
The test scripts were creating synthetic test frames using `cv2.putText()` to add text overlays, rather than capturing real video content from actual video sources.

### 🔧 Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Real Video Frame Capture System**
Created `test_real_video_alerts.py` that:
- ✅ Captures actual frames from real video files (buffer_video_*.mp4)
- ✅ Processes real video content at proper frame rates
- ✅ Maintains video quality with 90% JPEG compression
- ✅ Creates authentic video evidence for alerts

#### 2. **Enhanced Multi-Source Video Processing**
Updated `multi_source_video_analyzer.py` to:
- ✅ Capture real video frames with high quality encoding
- ✅ Include detailed frame metadata (timestamps, source info)
- ✅ Validate frame content before processing
- ✅ Handle multiple video sources simultaneously

#### 3. **Improved Video Creation Pipeline**
Enhanced `alerts.py` video creation:
- ✅ Multiple codec support (mp4v, XVID, H264, avc1)
- ✅ Better error handling for video encoding
- ✅ Reduced FFmpeg warnings through codec selection
- ✅ Maintained video quality in email attachments
