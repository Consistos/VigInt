# Video Compression Quality Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The video artifacts in email attachments were caused by aggressive compression settings in the `compress_video_for_email` function. The main issues were:

### Previous Issues:
1. **Aggressive quality reduction**: Default `quality_reduction=0.7` reduced resolution by 30%
2. **Poor codec choice**: Using older `mp4v` codec instead of modern H.264
3. **Excessive FPS reduction**: Double reduction (quality factor + frame skipping)
4. **Low-quality interpolation**: Basic resizing without proper interpolation
5. **Fixed compression approach**: Same settings regardless of actual compression needs

## Improvements Made

### 1. Adaptive Compression Strategy
- **Smart compression levels** based on actual size reduction needed
- **Preserve original resolution** when possible (light compression)
- **Gradual quality reduction** only when necessary

```python
# New adaptive approach
if compression_ratio_needed > 0.7:
    # Light compression - maintain resolution, reduce FPS slightly
    new_width = width
    new_height = height
    new_fps = max(15, int(fps * 0.8))
elif compression_ratio_needed > 0.4:
    # Medium compression - slight resolution reduction
    new_width = int(width * 0.9)
    new_height = int(height * 0.9)
    new_fps = max(12, int(fps * 0.7))
else:
    # Heavy compression - use quality_reduction factor
    new_width = int(width * quality_reduction)
    new_height = int(height * quality_reduction)
    new_fps = max(10, int(fps * quality_reduction))
```

### 2. Better Codec Selection
- **H.264 codec priority**: Modern, efficient compression
- **Multiple codec fallbacks**: Ensures compatibility
- **Automatic codec detection**: Uses best available option

```python
codec_options = [
    ('H264', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'H264')),
    ('avc1', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'avc1')),
    ('X264', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'X264')),
    ('mp4v', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'))  # Fallback
]
```

### 3. High-Quality Interpolation
- **Lanczos interpolation**: Better quality when resizing frames
- **Preserves fine details**: Reduces artifacts during scaling

```python
# Before: cv2.resize(frame, (width, height))
# After: cv2.resize(frame, (width, height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4)
```

### 4. Improved Default Settings
- **Higher quality default**: `quality_reduction=0.85` (was 0.7)
- **Configurable settings**: Added to config.ini for easy adjustment
- **Better balance**: Quality vs. file size optimization

### 5. Configuration Updates

Added new settings to `config.ini`:
```ini
[VideoAnalysis]
# Existing settings...
compression_quality = 0.85
max_email_size_mb = 20
preferred_codec = H264
```

## Expected Results

### Quality Improvements:
- **Reduced artifacts**: Better interpolation and codec
- **Preserved details**: Less aggressive compression
- **Smoother playback**: Smarter FPS reduction
- **Better compatibility**: H.264 codec support

### File Size Management:
- **Adaptive compression**: Only compress as much as needed
- **Configurable limits**: Easy to adjust size limits
- **Efficient encoding**: Better compression ratios with H.264

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
python test_video_compression.py
```

This will:
- Create a test video with visual patterns
- Test compression at different quality levels
- Compare original vs. compressed quality metrics
- Show codec usage and compression ratios

## Configuration Options

You can adjust these settings in `config.ini`:

```ini
[VideoAnalysis]
# Quality settings (0.1 = high compression, 0.9 = minimal compression)
compression_quality = 0.85

# Maximum email attachment size in MB
max_email_size_mb = 20

# Preferred video codec (H264, avc1, X264, mp4v)
preferred_codec = H264
```

## Monitoring

The system now logs:
- Codec used for compression
- Compression ratios achieved
- Quality preservation status
- File size reductions

Check logs for compression performance:
```bash
grep "Video compressed with" vigint.log
```

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor email delivery**: Check if recipients report better video quality
2. **Adjust settings if needed**: Increase `compression_quality` for better quality
3. **Test with real footage**: Use actual security camera footage for testing
4. **Consider alternative delivery**: For very high quality needs, consider cloud storage links

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can revert to previous settings:
```ini
[VideoAnalysis]
compression_quality = 0.7  # Previous default
preferred_codec = mp4v     # Previous codec
```

The system will automatically fall back to the old compression method.
