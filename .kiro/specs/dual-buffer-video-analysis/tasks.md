# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update configuration management for buffer settings
  - Add VideoAnalysis section to config.ini with buffer duration settings
  - Create configuration validation functions in config.py

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Implement enhanced client-side buffer management
  - [x] 2.1 Update SecureVideoAnalyzer class with configurable buffer durations
    - Read buffer configuration from config.ini on initialization
    - Update analysis_interval to use short_buffer_duration for more frequent monitoring
    - Add buffer configuration validation and error handling
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1_

  - [x] 2.2 Enhance video processing loop for continuous frame buffering
    - Modify process_video_stream to continuously add frames to buffer
    - Update frame processing to use dual buffer timing (every 3 seconds for analysis)
    - Ensure frame buffering doesn't block video capture
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [x] 2.3 Update async analysis method for dual buffer system
    - Rename _analyze_frame_async to _analyze_frames_async

    - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_
- [x] 5. Implement video generation system for incident evidence
  - [x] 5.1 Create enhanced video generation functions
    - Update create_video_from_frames to use configurable FPS and format
    - Add generate_incident_video function specifically for security incidents
    - Implement video quality optimization and format validation
    - Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for video creation
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

  - [x] 5.2 Implement temporary file management system
    - Create secure temporary file creation for incident videos
    - Add automatic cleanup mechanisms for temporary video files
    - Implement disk space checks and storage management
    - Add proper error handling for file system operations
    - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.2, 6.5_

- [x] 6. Enhance email alert system with video attachments
  - [x] 6.1 Update security alert email generation
    - Modify send_security_alert API endpoint to generate incident videos
    - Update email template to include detailed incident information

    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

  - [x] 6.2 Implement enhanced email content structure
    - Create detailed email body with initial and contextual analysis
    - Add incident metadata including risk level, frame counts, and timestamps
    - Include incident summary

    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.5_

  - [x] 6.3 Add robust error handling for email delivery
    - Implement fallback to text-only alerts if video attachment fails
    - Add retry mechanisms for SMTP failures
    - Handle attachment size limits with video compression options
    - Add proper logging for email delivery status and errors
    - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_
