# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing video analysis system with a dual buffer architecture that provides more comprehensive security incident detection and response. The system will maintain two separate frame buffers with configurable durations: a short buffer for continuous monitoring and a longer buffer for detailed incident analysis. When security incidents are detected, the system will generate video clips from the longer buffer and send them via email for immediate review.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want configurable buffer durations so that I can optimize the system for different monitoring scenarios and storage constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read buffer duration settings from config.ini
2. IF short_buffer_duration is specified in config.ini THEN the system SHALL use that value for the monitoring buffer
3. IF long_buffer_duration is specified in config.ini THEN the system SHALL use that value for the incident analysis buffer
4. IF buffer durations are not specified THEN the system SHALL use default values of 3 seconds for short buffer and 10 seconds for long buffer
5. WHEN buffer durations are changed in config.ini THEN the system SHALL apply new settings on restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want continuous monitoring of recent frames so that security incidents can be detected quickly without missing critical events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video frames are captured THEN the system SHALL maintain a rolling buffer of the last N seconds as configured
2. WHEN the short buffer reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL remove oldest frames to maintain the configured duration
3. WHEN analyzing for security incidents THEN the system SHALL process frames from the short buffer
4. IF a security incident is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger detailed analysis of the long buffer
5. WHEN no security incident is detected THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring without generating alerts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want detailed context when incidents occur so that I can understand the full sequence of events leading to the security alert.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident is detected in the short buffer THEN the system SHALL analyze the complete long buffer for context
2. WHEN analyzing the long buffer THEN the system SHALL provide detailed frame-by-frame analysis of suspicious activities
3. WHEN generating incident reports THEN the system SHALL include both the initial detection and the contextual analysis
4. IF the long buffer contains insufficient data THEN the system SHALL analyze available frames and note the limitation
5. WHEN incident analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive security report

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want video evidence of security incidents sent via email so that I can quickly review and respond to threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident is detected THEN the system SHALL create a video file from the long buffer frames
2. WHEN creating the incident video THEN the system SHALL include frames from before, during, and after the detected incident
3. WHEN sending security alerts THEN the system SHALL attach the incident video to the email notification
4. IF video creation fails THEN the system SHALL send the alert without attachment and log the error
5. WHEN the video is successfully attached THEN the email SHALL include metadata about the incident and video duration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient memory management so that the dual buffer system doesn't consume excessive resources during continuous operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing frame buffers THEN the system SHALL automatically remove expired frames based on configured durations
2. WHEN system memory usage exceeds safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL reduce buffer sizes temporarily
3. WHEN frames are added to buffers THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures to minimize memory overhead
4. IF memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation with reduced buffer capacity and log warnings
5. WHEN buffers are full THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth video processing without frame drops

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want reliable video file generation so that incident evidence is always available for review and investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating incident videos THEN the system SHALL use a standard video format compatible with common players
2. WHEN encoding video files THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient quality for security analysis
3. WHEN video generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL continue normal monitoring operations
4. IF video encoding fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative settings and log the issue
5. WHEN videos are created THEN the system SHALL include timestamp overlays for precise incident timing
